# omg_waffles_bot
Finds anyone on Twitter tweeting the exact phrase "i want waffles" and responds to that particular user with "*gives you waffles". Ensures that we don't hassle anyone who has already been responded to.

You may need to run the following commands in order to get this script running if you don't have gcc, ruby, and/or twitter already installed:

sudo apt-get install build-essential

sudo apt-get install ruby-all-dev

sudo gem install twitter --include-dependencies
